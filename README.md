# AMD HPC Training Examples Repo

Welcome to AMD's HPC Training Examples Repo!

(Last revision of this README: **April 2nd, 2025**).

Here you will find a variety of examples to showcase the capabilities of AMD's GPU software stack.
Please be aware that the repo is continuously updated to keep up with the most recent releases of the AMD software, and also to increase the number of examples and use cases that we strive to provide for our users.

## Repository Structure

Please refer to this table of contents to locate the exercises and examples you are interested in, sorted by topic.

1. [**HIP**](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/tree/main/HIP)
   1. ***HIP Functionality Checks***
      1. [`query_device`](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/tree/main/HIP/Stream_Overlap): checks that `hipMemGetInfo` works.
   2. ***Fundamental Examples***
      1. [`basic_examples`](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/tree/main/HIP/basic_examples): a collection of introductory exercises to get familiar with the HIP API and the HIP build process. Examples include an hipification of some CUDA code, device to host data transfer, error checking, and basic GPU kernel implementation. Begin here if you are just starting with HIP. [`README`](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/tree/main/HIP/basic_examples/README.md).
      2.

Note that AMD GPUs natively support the creation of multiple stream queues on the same GPU. The result is an additional gain in terms of time of execution due to the additional parallelism provided by the overlapping streams.
