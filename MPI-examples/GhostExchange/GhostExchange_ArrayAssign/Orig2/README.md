# Ghost Exchange Original Version 2

This version of the Ghost Exchange example modifies the original one (called [Orig](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/tree/main/MPI-examples/GhostExchange/GhostExchange_ArrayAssign/Orig)) by carrying out the computation of the blur kernel in an asycronous way. In more detail, the cells that do not need information from the cells in the ghost halos are advanced first. Then, the MPI communication is performed, which updates the value of the cells at the ghost cells, and then the solution is advanced on those cells that need information from cells on the ghost halos. 

This example is preparatory to the HIP implementation in [Ver8](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/tree/main/MPI-examples/GhostExchange/GhostExchange_ArrayAssign_HIP/Ver8), where the GPU kernel computation and the MPI exchange on CPU are overlapping. The aforementioned Ver8 example can be seen as a modification of Orig2 here where the CPU computation to advance the solution has been replaced with GPU HIP kernels.
