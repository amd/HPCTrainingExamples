# Porting excercise reduction into an array

This folder has two code versions:

#### 0) a serial cpu version 
to port yourself. 
Hint: don't forget to port the Makefile.

Build:
```
make
````
Run:
```
./reduction_array
```

#### 1) an openmp offload ported solution. 
The solution shows how you can do a reduction of multiple values into an array in one kernel.
