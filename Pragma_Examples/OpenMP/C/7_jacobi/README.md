# Porting a small app: jacobi
## AMD training container environment (aac6):
```
module load rocm
export CC=amdclang++
```
Note: CC is used in the Makefile as otherwise the compiler wrappers in the HPE environment on aac7 do not work.
## Cray environment (aac7):
```
module load craype-accel-amd-gfx942
module load craype-x86-genoa
module load PrgEnv-amd
module load rocm
```
make sure 
```
CC --versionÂ´
```
shows a c++ compiler.

## Excercise:
```
cd 0_jacobi_portyourself
```
decide if you want to port with or without unified shared memory.
Either for USM
```
export HSA_XNACK=1
```
or without for a behaviour with copies
```
export HSA_XNACK=0
```
```
make
```
run the code for a reference CPU solution.
```
./Jacobi_omp
```
you can specify a problem size with
```
./Jacobi_omp -m <Problemsize>
```
otherwise a default of ```<Problemsize> = 4096``` is set.
On the CPU the default problem size may take a minute to get solved, on the GPU it should be solved in a matter of second(s).

- port the Makefile
- add omp requires unified memory (in case export HSA_XNACK=1)
- port the loops
- test functionality and output after each loop you ported
- make sure the kernels really run on the GPU
- introduce map clauses (in case ```export HSA_XNACK=1``` is set)
- optimize data movement (in case ```export HSA_XNACK=0``` is set)

## Example solutions:
For the unified shared memory version:
```
export HSA_XNACK=1
cd 1_jacobi_usm
make
./Jacobi_omp
```
compare with your solution (e.g. use vimdiff to compare)

For the discrete GPU / manual memory management version:
```
export HSA_XNACK=0
cd 2_jacobi_targetdata
make
./Jacobi_omp
```
compare the output with your solution, you may want to inspect the solution and compare to your implementation (e.g. use vimdiff to compare)
