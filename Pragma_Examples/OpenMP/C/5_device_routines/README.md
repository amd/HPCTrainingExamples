# Porting excercise device routine and unified shared memory

This exercise will show how to port kernels which call a function.
Note: Make and build analogous to the previous excercises.

There are three different versions:
```
cd 1_device_routine 
```
```
cd 2_device_routine_wglobaldata  
```
```
cd 3_device_routine_wdynglobaldata
```
Each version has a sub-folder with a CPU serial version to port yourself and a solution for unified memory and with map clauses.
