# Porting excercise device routine

This exercise will show how to port kernels which call a function.
Note: Make and build analogous to the previous excercises.
Each version has a sub-folder with a 
- serial CPU version to port yourself and a
- solution for unified memory and
- a asolution with map clauses.

Build and run analogous to the previous excercises.

There are three different versions:
```
cd 1_device_routine 
```
```
cd 2_device_routine_wglobaldata  
```
```
cd 3_device_routine_wdynglobaldata
```
