# porting exercise: reduction

This excercise focusses on two things:
- how to port a reduction to the GPU
- be careful with mapping clauses on discrete GPUs / HSA_XNACK=0

in this folder four are three versions:

0) a version to port yourself. 
- Only port the Makefile and the reduction itself.
This excercise focusses on how to implement a reduction, not on porting the full example. Decide if you want to use unified memory (```export HSA_XNACK=1```) or not (```export HSA_XNACK=0```), but for this excercise this is of minor importance.

How to build all four versions
```
make
```
and run
```
./freduce
```
The other folders 1 and 2 have different flavors of the solution:
1) a sample solution for discrete GPUs (correct output: each element 1010) run this with setting ```export HSA_XNACK=0``` in advance
2) a sample solution for unified shared memory / APU programming model (correct output: each element 1010)  run this with setting ```export HSA_XNACK=1``` in advance

The folder 3 has an excercise to explore the behavior with and without USM:

3) this example intentionally does the mapping wrong (from instead of to). You can see how the result changes (output 1000 instead of 1010) when you use export ```export XSA_XNACK=0```. No error is shown, but the result is wrong. 
Test the same wrong code with ```export HSA_XNACK=1```, then the result is correct again as mapping clauses are ignored.
Take home message: if you develop for both APUs and discrete GPUs on MI300A, check if the results are the same for ```HSA_XNACK=0``` and ```=1``` as map clauses will be ignored with ```HSA_XNACK=1```! Ignoring memory copies is great for code portability and performance without code changes, but be careful to include proper validation checks during development for both discrete GPUs and APUs.
