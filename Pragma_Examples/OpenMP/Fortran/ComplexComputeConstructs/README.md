# OpenMP complex compute constructs in Fortran

README.md from `HPCTrainingExamples/Pragma_Examples/OpenMP/Fortran/ComplexComputeConstructs` in the Training Examples repository

To compile:

```
module load amdclang
make 
```

Note from above that you do not need to do `export HSA_XNACK=1` for these examples.
These exercises explore more complex compute constructs. The exercises are analogous to those in `../../C/ComplexComputeConstructs` so we recommend you check out the instructions in the [`README`](https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples/blob/main/Pragma_Examples/OpenMP/C/ComplexComputeConstructs/README.md) located in that directory for details about the specific examples.
