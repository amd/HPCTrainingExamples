# rocprofv3

One of the easiest tools to identify GPU kernel hotspots in an application is `rocprofv3`, available in ROCm 6.2.0 and onward. `rocprofv3` can be launched with a following command:

```
rocprofv3 --stats --kernel-trace --output-directory single_process --output-file kernels --output-format csv -- python3 <app with arguments>
```

An example of this is shown in `kernels.sh`. `--kernel-trace` specifies that one is interested in GPU kernel activity, while `--stats` option will enable generating summary of the `--kernel-trace`. Specifying names for output directory and files is optional but can be convenient. Using the csv output format (default before ROCm 7.0) will produce a number of files per process. For example, with the configuration above you will be provided with the following outputs:

```bash
ls single_process
kernels_agent_info.csv  kernels_domain_stats.csv  kernels_kernel_stats.csv  kernels_kernel_trace.csv
```

At a high-level view, the kernels_kernel_stats.csv file may be the most useful for identifying which kernels are of particular interest. For the run above, the top kernels of this unoptimized application are:

```bash
head kernels_kernel_stats.csv

Let's compare that to the top kernels in a parallel run, from `slurm_kernels.sh` or `mpi_kernels.sh`, depending on your system:

From the above, we can clearly identify that the most expensive kernels in this application are now collective communications (`rccl_main_kernel`) and kernels that are relevant to this AI model (resnet): gemm and batchnorm, both forward and backwards. As expected, the rccl doesn't appear as a top kernel in the single-process run since there is no communication.

<!-- Note: when output file name is not specified, `rocprofv3` will give each output file a unique name based on process ID. For scale out jobs, it's useful to control the output directory to a local scratch space to prevent collision. You can control both the output file basename and directory with the arguments `-o` and `-d` respectively. -->

`rocprofv3` can also output the same information in a trace-based view, that can be visualized with Perfetto. To configure this, change the output format to pftrace: 

```bash 
mpirun -n 4 rocprofv3 --sys-trace --output-format pftrace --output-directory mpi --output-file pid%pid%_traces -- python3 <app with arguments>
```

Example traces look like the image below, where users can zoom in and out and learn detailed information about the performance of each kernel.

![Rocprofv3 trace of the training application](rocprofv3-trace-output.png)

In the image above, the highlighted kernel (small black box with a line coming from it) is a `rocclr_copyBuffer`, and the orange boxes to the right are more collective kernels. The green kernels to the left are all compute kernels from the model's forward and backward pass.

<!-- `rocprofv3` will serialize kernel dispatches to ensure that only one dispatch is ever in flight.  So, for some kernels that are expected to be overlapped (communication/computation, for example), `rocprofv3` will not provide valuable profiling information for measuring stream concurrency.  For determining which kernels are most expensive, however, `rocprofv3` can be very useful. -->
